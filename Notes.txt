EXPLANATION OF ENDLESS

IMAGES ARRAY
-The num property is used for sorting and keeping track of images


IMAGENUM
-The index of the image that's currently showing

-Because of arrange constantly re-arranging the object,
the numbers are not permanently linked to the object

-With 4 images, imageNum is really only 1 or 2 (2nd and 3rd images)
-It's only 0 or 3, very briefly, before arrange() re-arranges the object




IMAGEPOS
-This is the current position of the "slides" div (the div that holds all the images)
-This works the same as imageNum, only it handles the position of the div
-It's only ever -700, or -1400 (the 2nd and 3rd images (1,2))







ARRANGE
-This only happens after a transition

Left
-If we're at the beginning
 -Pop off element at the end
 -Add the element to the beginning
 *Remove transition from "slides"
 *Change the element's position (setting the pos to -700, or the 2nd image in the array)
 *Add transition to "slides"
 -Change the imageNum to 1 (2nd element)
 -Change ImagePos to the 2nd element (-700)
 -Add Images back to page (the currently viewed image should not move)

Right
-If we're at the end
 -Remove element from beginning of Array
 -Push the element on to the end of the array
 *Remove transition from "slides"
 *Change the elements position to 2nd from last (-imageWidth * (images.length-2))
 *Add the transition to "slides"
 -Change the imageNum to second from last (images.length-2)
 -Change the imagePos to second from last (-imageWidth * (images.length-2))
 -Add images back to page (the currently viewed image should not move)


IMAGENUM
-This is the index of the currently viewed image
-This number is not permanently linked to specific images, because the array get re-arranged

DOTNUM
-This num is linked to images[i].num. In other words, 0 is ALWAYS Chicago
-This is needed specifically for image-selection (dots)




DOT CLICK
-Reset the array
-Get current position of the image
-Change the position after the reset (so it stays on the same image)
-Pull off the number from the dot class (d0,d1,etc). num
-Set the imageNum = dotnum. (They're both the same after a reset)
-Move the slide
-Change imageNum and dotNum to new image. This happens before the arrange() function
-ChangeDot


CHANGEPOS
-This removes the transition, then changes the margin-left, then re-adds the transition
-The offsetHeight is used to force a reflow
